# Case_Study_1_Bike_Share
## Google Data Analytics Case Study 1 - How cdoes a bike-share navigate speedy success?

Lily Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
